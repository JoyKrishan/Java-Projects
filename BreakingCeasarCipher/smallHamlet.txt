Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
Just a test string with lots of eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Hi my name is Joy and I have no friends except one good friend whose name is Jobel
She is there when I need her but as you know I cannot take people for granted and cannot rely on anyone.
Because this time I am hurt. You can me crying right at night and some nights I cannot sleep.
I know no one will listen to my pity stories and I have to lift myself up no matter how difficult it gets.
I always heard if we want something very dearly we do get it and I will never stop working until I am best in the business.
Because I have only one life and I will find the higher purpose and make my parents  happier.
